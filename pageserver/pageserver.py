"""
  A trivial web server in Python.

  Based largely on https://docs.python.org/3.4/howto/sockets.html
  This trivial implementation is not robust:  We have omitted decent
  error handling and many other things to keep the illustration as simple
  as possible.

  FIXME:
  Currently this program always serves an ascii graphic of a cat.
  Change it to serve files if they end with .html or .css, and are
  located in ./pages  (where '.' is the directory from which this
  program is run).
